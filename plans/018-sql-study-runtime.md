# Durable study progress

Study pages now read an account-scoped Dexie projection and send immutable review
events to the SQL study service. Local recording commits the event and displayed
progress together before networking. SQL commits each scheduling update and its
UUIDv7 receipt in one transaction; exact retries return their receipt and current progress without
counting a review twice. Existing imported cumulative totals remain the baseline.

The browser claims one account event at a time across tabs. A GET snapshot may
already contain an event whose reply was lost, so it cannot replace that set's
baseline while an uncertain local event is pending. Once exact receipts settle,
the authoritative snapshot is combined with later queued events. Unknown,
malformed and transient failures remain retryable. Explicit permanent failures
retain their event evidence but do not inflate the authoritative displayed totals.

Anonymous progress has a stable separate device identity and never becomes an
account outbox. An offline restart can reopen only the previously verified local
account. Explicit sign-out hides account views synchronously, aborts network and
identity work, persists the signed-out state and informs other tabs. Account rows
and unsent events remain associated with their original owner. Fresh verified
activation is required to resume after sign-out.

Quiz state survives same-set repository refreshes; storage errors are visible
rather than an indefinite spinner. Views are keyed to their exact account and
set, so account or route changes cannot display the preceding snapshot. The
existing scheduling behavior and repetition/supermemo modes are preserved.

The schema/import boundary was committed separately in migration 0014. This
runtime unit does not apply it to Neon, copy legacy browser rows automatically,
activate the global login switch or deploy. The earlier legacy recovery archive
remains separate from new study storage.

Root review corrected lost-reply baseline double counting, permanent rejection of
unknown outcomes, quiz unmounts after answers, hidden storage failures and delayed
or cross-tab identity changes after sign-out. Fifty-three focused tests cover SQL
receipts, fake IndexedDB, actual hooks/quiz continuity and route boundaries.
Evidence: `/tmp/magickli-study-runtime-{tests,types,biome,build}.log`.

The frozen isolated runtime passes all 53 focused tests, TypeScript, targeted
Biome, ordinary Loom check and a production build. No live SQL or provider
requests were made.

## Loom client-data extraction checkpoint

The 21 September 2026 consumer adapter preserves the study database schema and
wire messages while routing identity transitions and revision ordering through
`@gadicc/loom/client-data`. It deliberately does not strengthen two existing
activation policies during the mechanical extraction.

First, `accountViewsFenced` and the ritual runtime's corresponding refresh fence
live only for the current JavaScript runtime. If explicit local sign-out becomes
durable but the server cookie remains valid, a reload creates a new runtime. Its
automatic mount, online or visibility refresh reads the identity baseline after
the sign-out and can reactivate the cookie's account. The shared explicit
sign-out revision orders a session check that began before sign-out; it does not
decide whether a later verified session came from intentional reauthentication.

A separate app policy change should durably require explicit sign-in intent
after requested sign-out, set that requirement before the auth request, and
clear it only after the app observes a successful user-initiated sign-in for the
verified owner. Automatic session refresh may confirm connectivity but must not
clear that requirement. The study and ritual browser runtimes must enforce the
same decision so one cannot reopen while the other remains fenced.

Second, a generation token orders checks inside one runtime, but cannot order
competing activations in different tabs. The current transaction preserves the
historical last-writer behavior. A later fix needs durable activation-attempt
ordering or an equivalent compare-and-swap protocol. Rejecting every revision
change is not equivalent because the existing policy intentionally allows a
verified activation to follow another tab's anonymous answer.

The adapter is now validated against the exact published
`@gadicc/loom@1.30.0` dependency with no local package override. Its focused
storage tests, TypeScript check, targeted Biome check and production Loom gate
pass. The earlier production browser build used the package-equivalent artifact
from the same Loom release commit.
